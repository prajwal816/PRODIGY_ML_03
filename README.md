## Dogs vs. Cats Classification using SVM

### Overview
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of dogs and cats. Using image data, the model learns to distinguish between the two animal categories with high accuracy. This project serves as an example of binary image classification using machine learning techniques.

### Features
Utilizes an SVM classifier for binary image classification.
Trained on a dataset of labeled images of dogs and cats.
Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between dog and cat images.

### How it Works
The SVM model takes in preprocessed image data, extracts key features, and builds a decision boundary to classify images as either a dog or a cat. The model is trained on labeled examples, and it learns to make predictions based on image features. The kernel function of the SVM enhances the modelâ€™s ability to handle complex data distributions.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of images of dogs and cats, preprocessed into a uniform size for consistency.
Labeled images are used for supervised training.
